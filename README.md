## *The Journey of a Data Scientist* ##


Project 1 
BCG Open Access Advance Analytics and Machine Learning.( Churn Prediction)
PowerCo is a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to corporate, SME (Small & Medium Enterprise), and residential customers. The power-liberalization of the energy market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in the SME segment. They have partnered with BCG to help diagnose the source of churning SME customers.
One of the hypotheses under consideration is that churn is driven by the customers’ price sensitivities and that it is possible to predict customers likely to churn using a predictive model. The client also wants to try a discounting strategy, with the head of the SME division suggesting that offering customers at high propensity to churn a 20% discount might be effective.
We have been asked to go deeper on the hypothesis that the churn is driven by the customers’ price sensitivities. Detail in the repo 2
Project 4
Predicting Boston Housing Prices: A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical modelling tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
