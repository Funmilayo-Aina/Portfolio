[Entry level challenge(Data Analytics Track)](https://github.com/Funmilayo-Aina/Entrylevel-Challenge-Data-Analytics-Track)
- Input
 #### Udemy Business Analysis
 
There is a need for increasing revenue generation by Udemy.
We have been asked to analyze the given historical dataset for trends that could show the impact of increasing the cost of web development courses as a means of generating the desired revenue.

- Background

Tracking courses performance on revenue generation and analyzing if charging more on popular courses would have a positive impact on Udemy revenue generation.
Understanding where opportunities to increase revenue may lie.
Furthermore analysis would allow us to size the business impact of a proposed increments.

 - Designs
 
The data were cleaned with Google sheet and exported to Tableau for visualization.
- Findings
- 
[👩View findings on Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/funmilayo.aina)

There were missing values in some columns while some columns have duplicate values. The duplicates were removed.
The data was recorded with time stamp, we therefore transform the date to date only removing time stamp.
Analysis of finding from the root cause
The top 20 courses were web development courses. The review for the courses were also high.
The rating for paid courses was high showing customers satisfactions.
The number of course in top 20 and paid were more than those in free range.
All level courses and Beginner courses have the highest level of subscribers filtered by rating.
From hours of lecture reviews we may need to increase the hours for Web development courses.
All level courses generates the highest revenue and web development tops the chart.
The subscription for Expert level courses is extremely low, we need not increase the prices of those courses to prevent churning.

- Conclusion

The top 20 courses were truly web development courses. The reviews for the courses were also high as well rating for these courses indicating customers’ satisfactions.
All level courses generates the highest revenue and web development tops the chart.
 Dates shows a regular subscription trends. Therefore increasing the prices of ‘All level courses’ are ‘‘Beginner courses’ that are ‘Web Development courses’ would increase Udemy’s revenue generation.
I recommend non increment of 'Expert level courses' to prevent churning.

[BCG Open Access Advance Analytics and Machine Learning( Churn Prediction)](https://github.com/Funmilayo-Aina/BCG-Open-Access-Data-Science-Advanced-Analytics-Virtual-Experience-Program)![h-heyerlein-ndja2LJ4IcM-unsplash](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84969489/128058856-824cc3d6-3995-471b-830d-406eb0b2c3eb.jpg)

- Input

PowerCo is a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to corporate, SME (Small & Medium Enterprise), and residential customers. The power-liberalization of the energy market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in the SME segment. They have partnered with BCG to help diagnose the source of churning SME customers.
One of the hypotheses under consideration is that churn is driven by the customers’ price sensitivities and that it is possible to predict customers likely to churn using a predictive model. The client also wants to try a discounting strategy, with the head of the SME division suggesting that offering customers at high propensity to churn a 20% discount might be effective.
We have been asked to go deeper on the hypothesis that the churn is driven by the customers’ price sensitivities. Detail in the repo
- Output and impact: 
  After advanced data analysis and modelling. The was a clear evidence that discount would not prevent customers from churning
