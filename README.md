 #### Udemy Business Analysis ####
 
 ##### About Project #####

There is a need for increasing revenue generation by Udemy.
We have been asked to analyze the given historical dataset for trends that could show the impact of increasing the cost of web development courses as a means of generating the desired revenue.

Tracking courses performance on revenue generation and analyzing if charging more on popular courses would have a positive impact on Udemy revenue generation.
Understanding where opportunities to increase revenue may lie.
Furthermore analysis would allow us to size the business impact of a proposed increments.

##### About project #####

PowerCo is a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to corporate, SME (Small & Medium Enterprise), and residential customers. The power-liberalization of the energy market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in the SME segment. They have partnered with BCG to help diagnose the source of churning SME customers.
One of the hypotheses under consideration is that churn is driven by the customers’ price sensitivities and that it is possible to predict customers likely to churn using a predictive model. The client also wants to try a discounting strategy, with the head of the SME division suggesting that offering customers at high propensity to churn a 20% discount might be effective.
We have been asked to go deeper on the hypothesis that the churn is driven by the customers’ price sensitivities. Detail in the repo
- Output and impact: 
  After advanced data analysis and modelling. The was a clear evidence that discount would not prevent customers from churning
